				cpan-watcher

This is a script for determining what's new on CPAN. It works by keeping
a database of what was seen the last time you ran the script.

We will be using this script to generate a "What's new on CPAN"
on our web pages, at http://www.cre.canon.co.uk/perl/

Once cpan-watcher has determined what's new, it can:

   *	generate a web page, with links to the perl.com CPAN multiplexor,
	to make it easy to grab things.

   *	send a mail message to interested parties.

To install this script, you should just have to run the following:

	% perl Makefile.PL
	% make install

The script is fully documented using pod. Once installed you should get
a man page. It also supports an informational switch:

	-help	display a short help message

The script requires the following, which are also available from CPAN:

	Net::FTP
	App::Config

I'd be happy to hear of any suggestions for improving this script;
the ToDo list and possible ideas for future work are listed in the doc.
